# Data Analysis Project: GDP and Life Expectancy

This project focuses on analysing the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy at Birth using the data provided in the `all_data.csv` file. The aim is to determine whether higher GDP is associated with longer life expectancy.

## **1. Project Overview**
- **Purpose**: Investigate the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy at Birth.
- **Key Goals**:
  - Analyse the distribution of GDP and Life Expectancy across different countries and years.
  - Identify any significant correlations or patterns in the data.
- **Prediction**: There is a relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy at Birth.

---

## **2. Data Collection**
- **Purpose**: Use the `all_data.csv` file as the primary dataset for analysis.
- **Dataset Information**:
  - Columns: `Country`, `Year`, `Life expectancy at birth (years)`, and `GDP`.
  - The data includes records from multiple countries over different years.

## **3. Data Cleaning**
- **Purpose**: Prepare the dataset for analysis by addressing potential issues like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Handle missing values (e.g., by dropping rows with NaN).
  - Rename columns for consistency: `Life expectancy at birth (years)` â†’ `Life_Expectancy`.
  - Remove duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy.

## **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Purpose**: Gain insights into the data by visualising distributions and relationships.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Visualise the distribution of GDP and Life Expectancy using histograms.
  - Create a scatter plot to observe the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy.
  - Use color coding (`hue`) to differentiate data points by country.

## **5. Statistical Analysis**
- **Purpose**: Quantify and validate the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Calculate the correlation coefficient to measure the strength of the relationship.
  - Summarise statistical findings to support or refute the hypothesis.

## **6. Data Visualisation**
- **Purpose**: Represent data and findings effectively using various plots.
- **Visualisations**:
  - Scatter plot to highlight the relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy.
  - Boxplot to show Life Expectancy distributions across countries.
  - Histograms for GDP and Life Expectancy distributions.

---

## **7. Reporting Insights**
- **Purpose**: Summarise the findings and draw meaningful conclusions.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Provide the correlation coefficient between GDP and Life Expectancy.
  - Interpret whether higher GDP is associated with longer Life Expectancy.
  - Highlight any limitations or further analysis opportunities.
